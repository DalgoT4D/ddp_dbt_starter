2. Install dbt normally (make sure to install with dbt-postgres) in virtual env
3. ```dbt --version``` to check dbt-core and postgres adapter are installed and working
4. add profililes.yaml in ~/.dbt/ and complete the login creds for dev


```

      type: postgres
      threads: 4
      host: [host]
      port: [port]
      user: [dev_username]
      pass: [dev_password]
      dbname: [dbname]
      schema: [dev_schema]
